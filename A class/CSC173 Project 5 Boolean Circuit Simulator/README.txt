Simple Boolean circuit simulator written in C.

NAND gates:
1. Implemented by using ! to invert the results of AND
2. To run across all possible combinations, we use the function "ret" to help us combine all possible combinations

Extra Credit:
We implemented the one-bit adder circuit of FOCS Fig. 13.10 and tested on all possible combinations.

Building and Running:
1. Build:
To build in the bash terminal, type 'make'
2. To run"
Type "./boosim" without the apostrophes.
